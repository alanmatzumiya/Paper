## Information About Data

In the files called 'xSpace.npy' and 'times.npy', the discretization of space and time are stored respectively. 

In the files 'data_1.npy' and 'data_2' are contained the solutions of the approximation of the numerical method for the initial conditions (1) and (2) respectively. The data is organized in a two-dimensional array, where each column represents the solution in each point of the space and each row represents the solution in time. For example, if we fix a row and go through all the columns, we will obtain the solutions in the whole space during a certain time.

Finally, the file 'norma.npy' contains the distances between the approximate solutions given the initial conditions (1) and (2) using the norm established in the paper.
