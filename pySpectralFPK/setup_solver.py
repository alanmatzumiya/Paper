    Solves the Burgers Stochastic equation on 1D using Spectral method
    based on the spectral decomposition of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup
    associated to the Kolmogorov equation and compute the norm between two solutions
    with different initial conditions for a fixed point in real space.
